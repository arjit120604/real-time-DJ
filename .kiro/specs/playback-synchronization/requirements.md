# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical flaws in the current collaborative music player synchronization system. The current implementation uses a fragile "stateful offset" model that creates complex state management, network latency issues, and synchronization problems. This feature will replace it with a robust "absolute timestamp" model that provides universal, self-correcting synchronization for all users in a room, regardless of when they join or their network conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user in a collaborative music room, I want all participants to hear the same part of a song at the same time, so that we can have a synchronized listening experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a song is playing THEN all users SHALL hear the exact same timestamp of the song within 100ms accuracy
2. WHEN a new user joins a room with an active song THEN their player SHALL automatically sync to the current playback position
3. WHEN network latency occurs THEN the synchronization SHALL self-correct without manual intervention
4. WHEN a user experiences a temporary connection issue THEN their player SHALL automatically resync upon reconnection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user controlling playback, I want to pause and resume songs for everyone in the room, so that I can coordinate the listening experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user pauses playback THEN all users in the room SHALL have their players paused immediately
2. WHEN a user resumes playback THEN all users SHALL resume from the exact same timestamp where the pause occurred
3. WHEN playback is resumed after a pause THEN the system SHALL calculate the correct universal timeline without accumulated drift
4. IF multiple pause/resume actions occur rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle them without state corruption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user in a collaborative room, I want to seek to different parts of a song for everyone, so that we can jump to specific sections together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user seeks to a specific timestamp THEN all users in the room SHALL jump to that exact position
2. WHEN a seek operation is performed THEN the system SHALL establish a new universal timeline from that position
3. WHEN multiple users attempt to seek simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process requests in order and maintain consistency
4. IF a seek operation fails for some users THEN those users SHALL automatically resync to the correct position

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want a simple and robust synchronization architecture, so that the codebase is maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing synchronization logic THEN the server SHALL only manage a single authoritative timestamp
2. WHEN clients need to sync THEN they SHALL calculate their position using a simple universal formula
3. WHEN adding new synchronization features THEN the core model SHALL remain unchanged
4. IF synchronization state becomes corrupted THEN the system SHALL be able to recover by recalculating from the authoritative timestamp

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user experiencing network issues, I want the player to automatically stay in sync, so that I don't miss parts of the collaborative experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network latency delays a sync command THEN the client SHALL automatically compensate using current time
2. WHEN a client receives outdated sync information THEN it SHALL calculate the correct current position
3. WHEN connection is restored after a dropout THEN the player SHALL seamlessly sync without user intervention
4. IF sync drift is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically correct without disrupting playback
