# Guest Login Workflow - Fixed and Tested

## Issue Identified
The guest login workflow was broken because:
- Frontend was waiting for a `roomJoined` event that the backend never emitted
- Backend only emits `roomState` event after successful room join
- This caused the guest login to timeout and fail

## Fix Applied
Updated `frontend/src/pages/login.tsx` in the `handleGuestJoin` function:

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
socket.on('roomJoined', onRoomJoined);  // This event never comes!
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
socket.on('roomState', onRoomState);    // This is what backend actually sends
```

## Backend Flow Confirmed
When a guest joins a room, the backend:
1. Validates the room exists (guests can't create rooms)
2. Generates a unique guest ID: `guest_${uuid}`
3. Stores user info in Redis with `isGuest: true`
4. Joins the socket to the room
5. Broadcasts `userJoined` event to other users
6. Sends `roomState` event to the joining user

## Testing Results

### Backend Logs Show Success:
```
Guest guest_a6d31b2f-7fe6-442a-9080-8e3684e22282 (222) joining room 222
User guest_a6d31b2f-7fe6-442a-9080-8e3684e22282 added to Redis set for room 222
Room 222 state: { playlistLength: 0, userCount: 8, hasCurrentSong: false }
Sending roomState to user guest_a6d31b2f-7fe6-442a-9080-8e3684e22282: {
  playlistLength: 0,
  userCount: 8,
  currentSong: 'none',
  isPlaying: undefined
}
```

### All Tests Pass:
- âœ… Frontend tests: 20/20 passed
- âœ… Backend tests: 49/49 passed
- âœ… Guest user identification working
- âœ… Room joining workflow functional

## Guest Login Workflow Now Works:
1. User clicks "Join as Guest" on login page
2. Enters username and room ID
3. Frontend emits `joinRoom` with `isGuest: true`
4. Backend validates room exists
5. Backend sends `roomState` event
6. Frontend receives event and navigates to room
7. Guest appears in room with proper identification

## Error Handling:
- Room not found: Shows appropriate error message
- Invalid input: Validates username and room ID
- Timeout: 10-second timeout for socket response
- Network issues: Proper error handling and user feedback

The guest login workflow is now fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
