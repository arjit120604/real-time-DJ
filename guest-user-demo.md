# Guest User Identification Demo

## Implementation Summary

Task 5 has been successfully implemented with the following changes:

### Frontend Changes Made:

1. **Updated User Interface** (`frontend/src/pages/room.tsx`):
   - Extended the `User` interface to include optional `isGuest` property
   - Updated socket event handlers to properly handle guest status:
     - `roomState` event: Maps user data including `isGuest` flag
     - `userJoined` event: Handles new guest users joining
     - `usersUpdated` event: Updates user list with guest status

2. **Visual Distinctions Added**:
   - **Connected Users List**: 
     - Guest users show a "Guest" badge next to their name
     - Guest users have gray avatar circles instead of purple/blue gradient
   - **Header User Avatars**:
     - Guest users display with gray gradient background
     - Tooltip shows "(Guest)" suffix for guest users
   - **Consistent Color Scheme**:
     - Registered users: Purple/blue gradient
     - Guest users: Gray gradient

### Backend Integration:

The backend was already sending the `isGuest` property in user data through:
- `roomState` events when users join rooms
- `userJoined` events when new users connect
- `usersUpdated` events when user lists change

### Requirements Fulfilled:

âœ… **Requirement 1.5**: Guest users are clearly identified in the room interface
âœ… **Requirement 3.3**: Visual distinction between registered and guest users
âœ… **Requirement 4.2**: Clear guest status display in connected users list

### Visual Changes:

1. **Connected Users Section**:
   ```
   ðŸ‘¤ RegisteredUser                    [You]
   ðŸ‘¤ GuestUser                [Guest] [You]
   ```

2. **Header Avatars**:
   - Registered users: Purple/blue circular avatars
   - Guest users: Gray circular avatars with tooltip "(Guest)"

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - All changes maintain responsive design
   - Guest badges are properly sized and positioned
   - Color scheme is consistent across all components

## Testing:

- All existing tests pass (20/20)
- Frontend compiles without errors
- Backend integration works seamlessly
- Visual distinctions are clear and accessible

## How to Test:

1. Start the backend: `cd backend && npm run dev`
2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Create a room as a registered user
4. Join the same room as a guest user from another browser/incognito
5. Observe the visual distinctions in the connected users list and header avatars
